# Sentune

Sentune is a web app that converts sentences into song titles by leveraging Spotify's web API search functionality. Inspired by [r/weirdspotifyplaylists](https://www.reddit.com/r/weirdspotifyplaylists/).

## Features

- Uses a 'greedy' recursive algorithm to find all possible consecutive word combinations within a sentence. It starts with the longest substring and, if no result is found, it breaks it apart and tries again until a result is found, or there are no more possible combinations to test.
- Background created with a canvas that simulates moving stars using a parallax effect. Each star is a unique object with random size, opacity, and speed, all constrained by a defined interval.
- Simple, user-friendly design with a responsive interface.
