# Sentune

Sentune is a web app that converts sentences into song titles by taking advantage of the Spotify's web API search functionality.

## Features

- It uses a 'greedy' recursive algorithm for finding all possible consecuetive word combinations in a sentence. It starts with the biggest piece of string and then if no result is found, it takes it apart and tries again until a result is found or until there are no more possible word combinations.
- Background is made with canvas and simulates moving stars with a parallax effect. Each 'star' is a different object with random size, opacity and speed, constrained by some interval.
- The design is simple and user friendly, with a responsive interface.
